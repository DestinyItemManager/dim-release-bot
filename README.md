## DIM Release Bot

The DIM release bot is a Travis CI job that releases the production version of Destiny Item Manager. The Beta version is released directly from the DIM source repository every time there is a commit. This job runs weekly, and releases the production version. It can also be run manually from the Travis console to immediately cut a release.
